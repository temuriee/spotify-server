### Data Flow Description

1. **Client-API Interaction**:

   - Client sends HTTP requests to the API endpoints
   - API validates requests and authenticates users via JWT
   - API returns appropriate responses with status codes

2. **API-Database Interaction**:

   - API uses Mongoose schemas to structure data
   - Performs CRUD operations on MongoDB collections
   - Handles relationships between collections through references

3. **Media Management Flow**:

   - Client uploads media (images/audio) through the API
   - API processes files with Multer
   - Files are uploaded to Cloudinary
   - Cloudinary URLs are stored in the database

4. **Authentication Flow**:
   - User registers/logs in via API
   - API validates credentials
   - JWT token generated and returned to client
   - Client includes token in subsequent requests
   - Token is verified for protected routes
